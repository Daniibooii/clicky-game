# clicky-game

# Project Description
A card-based memory game built using React.js, and focused on correctly-identifying species of crow.<br>
I hope you know your Corvi!<br>

# How to Use
Access the hosted version at: https://daniibooii.github.io/click-game/<br>
Or DL the repo, open it with Node or Yarn, and check localhost:3000<br>

To play, the user will select their first card. Each time a new card is clicked, a point will be added to the user's score and the cards will all be reshuffled.<br>
The goal of the game is to click each crow only once!<br>
Accidentally clicking the same crow will result in loss of points, and the game will restart.<br>

Happy birding!<br>

Create a memory game with React; break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, respond to user events.<br>
Create React application using Create React App.<br>
