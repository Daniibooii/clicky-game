# clicky-game

# Project Description
A card-based memory game built using React.js, and focused on correctly-identifying species of crow.<br>
I hope you know your Corvi!<br>

# How to Use
Access the hosted version at: https://daniibooii.github.io/click-game/<br>
Or DL the repo, open it with Node or Yarn, and check localhost:3000<br>

To play, the user will select their first card. Each time a new card is clicked, a point will be added to the user's score and the cards will all be reshuffled.<br>
The goal of the game is to click each crow only once!<br>
Accidentally clicking the same crow will result in loss of points, and the game will restart.<br>

Happy birding!<br>

## Project Goals
Create a memory game with React; break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, respond to user events.
Create React application using Create React App.
Render different images; each image should listen for click events.
Keep track of the user's score.
Increment user's score when image clicked for first time.
Reset score to zero if image clicked again.
Every time an image is clicked, the shuffle images in a random order.
Restart once user's score returns to zero.
